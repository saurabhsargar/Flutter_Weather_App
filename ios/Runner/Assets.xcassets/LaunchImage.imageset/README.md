# Launch Screen Assets

To update assets, replace the image files in this directory and ensure they follow the naming convention (e.g., LaunchImage@2x.webp). Use optimized formats like WebP for better performance.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.
